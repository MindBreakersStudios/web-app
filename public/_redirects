# AWS Amplify Redirects and Rewrites
# This file should be in the public/ directory

# SPA fallback - serve index.html for all routes (except static files)
/*    /index.html   200

# Serve static HTML files for bots (these have proper meta tags)
# Note: AWS Amplify will serve these files directly when requested
# Bots will see the meta tags, regular users will be redirected to SPA
